Bizdash
=========

Bizdash is short for Business Dashboard. There are a couple of things that I noticed any small business could use.
1. - Better commuincation between personnel, and email is not the solution.
2. - Better container tracking, certain container can cost well over $1500.00 dollars and it would be nice to track 
     them efficiently and in a cost friendly way.
3. - Document retention ie. scanned invoices
4. - SDS (Safety Data Sheets) and CofA (Certificates of Analysis) retention and easy way to disseminate them to customers
5. - Product label generation. Currently have a working beta version for the chemical industry.
